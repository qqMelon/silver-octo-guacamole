# WoW ElvUI addon updater/Installer

This project is just for update your version of ElvUI addon of World of Warcraft or install it quickly

## TODO

[x] Check remote version on ElvUI website
  * Upgrade the check without input of major version
[x] Check if remote version is different between our and it
[x] Download `.zip` file if the previous condition is true
[ ] Unzip `.zip` file downloaded
[ ] Only replace file and no delete the older ones

## Enhancement program

I try to use the **CurseForge** API to update all addons already installed
